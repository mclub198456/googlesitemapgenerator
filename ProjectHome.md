## Welcome to Google Sitemap Generator (Beta)! ##

Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling. By creating and submitting Sitemaps to search engines, you are more likely to get better freshness and coverage in search engines.

Google Sitemap Generator is a tool installed on your web server to generate the Sitemaps automatically. Unlike many other third party Sitemap generation tools, Google Sitemap Generator takes a different approach: it will monitor your web server traffic, and detect updates to your website automatically.

_**PRIVACY WARNING**: Any Sitemap information that you send to Google (including Sitemaps created using the Sitemap Generator) should be consistent with commitments you make to your users in your site's privacy policy.  If your site contains or generates URLs that contain user information, you must filter the user information out of the data that you send to Google. Instructions for filtering such information can be found at the Sitemap Generator configuration instructions [here](http://googlesitemapgenerator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/gsg-configuration.html#gsg_con_patterns). In addition, you must add language to your privacy policy substantially similar to "This site uses a tool which collects your requests for pages and passes elements of them to search engines to assist them in indexing this site. We control the configuration of the tool and are responsible for any information sent to the search engines."_
